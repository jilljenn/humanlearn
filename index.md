We host a 1-day workshop colocated with the [ITS 2018](http://its2018.its-conferences.com) conference to discuss specific algorithmic and machine learning issues for optimizing human learning.

# Motivation

**What should we learn next?** In this current era where digital access to knowledge is cheap and user attention is expensive, a number of online applications have been developed for learning. These platforms collect a massive amount of data over various profiles, that can be used to improve learning experience: intelligent tutoring systems can infer what activities worked for different types of students in the past, and apply this knowledge to instruct new students. In order to learn effectively and efficiently, the experience should be adaptive: the sequence of activities should be tailored to the abilities and needs of each learner, in order to keep them stimulated and avoid boredom, confusion and dropout.

Educational research communities have proposed models that predict mistakes and dropout, in order to detect students that need further instruction. There is now a need to design online systems that continuously learn as data flows, and self-assess their strategies when interacting with new learners. These models have been already deployed in online commercial applications (ex. streaming, advertising, social networks) for optimizing interaction, click-through-rate, or profit. Can we use similar methods to enhance the performance of teaching in order to promote lifetime success?

# Workshop Topics

- How to put the student in optimal conditions to learn? e.g. incentives, companion agents, etc.
- When optimizing human learning, which metrics should be optimized?
    - The progress of the learner?
    - The diversity or coverage of the proposed activities?
    - Can a learning platform be solely based on addiction, maximizing interaction?
- What kinds of activities give enough choice and control to the learner to benefit their learning (adaptability vs. adaptivity)?
- Do we want to enhance social interaction between learners?
- What feedback should be shown to the learner in order to allow reflective learning? e.g. visualization, learning map, score, etc. (Should a system provide a fake feedback in order to encourage the student more?)
- What student parameters are relevant? e.g. personality traits, mood, context (is the learner in class or at home?), etc.
- What explicit and implicit feedbacks does the learner provide during the interaction?
- What models of learning are relevant? E.g. cognitive models, modeling forgetting in spaced repetition.
- What specific challenges from the ML point of view are we facing with these data?
- Do we have enough datasets? What kinds of datasets are missing?
